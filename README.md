# Admin Panel for Yuuko

This is an internal admin panel made for our discord bot, Yuuko. This is so we can get rid of all internal commands on the bot so no user would even know of it's existence.

## TODO

- [ ] Fetch data from GitHub for GitHub statistics component
- [ ] Add & style buttons
- [ ] Conjure up the method to communicate with the bot (e.g getting the data, sending signals)
- [ ] Add authentication with Discord log-in
- [ ] Add mobile support
